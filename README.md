Creating Smallset Timelines with `smallsets`
================

## Introduction

Welcome to the `smallsets` software repository üëã. This is the companion
repository for the paper [**Smallset Timelines: A Visual Representation
of Data Preprocessing
Decisions**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3531146.3533175) in the
proceedings of ACM FAccT ‚Äô22. A short ([3
min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fpn02h3IUo)) and long ([15
min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_ksOv6rj1Y)) YouTube video provide
an introduction to the project.

**Do you use R or Python to preprocess datasets for analyses?** The
Smallset Timeline (or Timeline) is a practical visualisation to document
and communicate your data preprocessing decisions. `smallsets` is the R
package for creating a Smallset Timeline for your R or Python
preprocessing script.

*If you have questions about using `smallsets` or would like help
building a Smallset Timeline, please email Lydia at
<Lydia.Lucchesi@anu.edu.au>.*

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github(repo = "lydialucchesi/smallsets")
```

## Quick start example

**Copy, paste, and run the following snippet of code to create your
first Smallset Timeline!**

*Check out the following section to see how snapshots and captions are
added by ‚Äúcommenting‚Äù the preprocessing script.*

``` r
library(smallsets)
set.seed(107)

data(mydata)

Smallset_Timeline(
  data = mydata,
  code = system.file("preprocess_data.R", package = "smallsets")
  )
```

    ## [1] "3 snapshots taken"
    ## [1] "Alt text available in figureAltText.txt"

## Structured comments

The Smallset Timeline above is based on the R preprocessing script
below. Prior to building the Timeline with `Smallset_Timeline()`, a
series of structured comments were added to the preprocessing script,
informing `smallsets` what to do.

-   `# start smallset mydata` - start tracking code and take the first
    data snapshot

-   `# snap mydata` - take a data snapshot after the next line of code

-   `# end smallset mydata` - stop tracking code and take the last data
    snapshot

-   snapshot captions are added between caption brackets:
    `caption[...]caption`

This script is included in the package and can be viewed on GitHub here.

``` r
# start smallset mydata caption[Remove rows where C2 
# is FALSE.]caption
mydata <- mydata[mydata$C2 == TRUE,]

mC6 <- tapply(mydata$C6, mydata$C1, function(x)
  mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
C6sub <- as.factor(mydata$C1)
levels(C6sub) <- mC6
mydata$C6[is.na(mydata$C6)] <- round(as.numeric(levels(C6sub))[C6sub][is.na(mydata$C6)], 2)

mC8 <- tapply(mydata$C8, mydata$C1, function(x)
  mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
C8sub <- as.factor(mydata$C1)
levels(C8sub) <- mC8
# snap mydata caption[Replace missing values in C6 and 
# C8 with category (C1) means. Drop C7 (too many missing 
# values).]caption
mydata$C8[is.na(mydata$C8)] <- round(as.numeric(levels(C8sub))[C8sub][is.na(mydata$C8)], 2)

mydata$C7 <- NULL

mydata$C9 <- mydata$C3 + mydata$C4
# end smallset mydata caption[Create a new column, 
# C9, by summing C3 and C4.]caption
```

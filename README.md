Smallset Timelines with `smallsets`
================

## Introduction

Welcome to the `smallsets` software repository üëã. This is the companion
repository for the paper [**Smallset Timelines: A Visual Representation
of Data Preprocessing
Decisions**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3531146.3533175) in the
proceedings of ACM FAccT ‚Äô22. A short ([3
min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fpn02h3IUo)) and long ([15
min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_ksOv6rj1Y)) YouTube video provide
an introduction to the project.

**Do you use R or Python to preprocess datasets for analyses?**
`smallsets` is an R package that transforms your R or Python
preprocessing script into a Smallset Timeline, so that you can document
and share your preprocessing decisions in a practical manner.

*If you have questions about using `smallsets` or would like help
building a Smallset Timeline, please email Lydia at
<Lydia.Lucchesi@anu.edu.au>.*

## Installation in R

``` r
remotes::install_github(repo = "lydialucchesi/smallsets")
```

## Quick start example

<span style="color:#FF6633">**Copy, paste, and run the following snippet
of code to create your first Smallset Timeline!**</span>

*Check out the following section to see how to choose snapshot points
and provide captions with structured comments in the preprocessing
script.*

*There are many built-in options to customise the appearance of your
Smallset Timeline. See `?Smallset_Timeline` for details.*

``` r
library(smallsets)
set.seed(145)

data(mydata)

Smallset_Timeline(
  data = mydata,
  code = system.file("preprocess_data.R", package = "smallsets")
  )
```

    ## [1] "Selected Smallset rows: 2, 47, 54, 64, 75, 92"
    ## [1] "Number of snapshots: 3"
    ## [1] "Alt text available in figureAltText.txt"

## Structured comments

The Smallset Timeline above is based on the R preprocessing script
below. Prior to building the Timeline with `Smallset_Timeline()`, a
series of structured comments were added to the preprocessing script,
informing `smallsets` what to do.

-   `# start smallset mydata` - start tracking code and take the first
    data snapshot, where ‚Äúmydata‚Äù is the name of your data object

-   `# snap mydata` - take a data snapshot after the next line of code

-   `# end smallset mydata` - stop tracking code and take the last data
    snapshot

-   snapshot captions are added between caption brackets
    `caption[...]caption` at the end of structured comments

This script is included in the package and can be viewed on GitHub here.

``` r
# start smallset mydata caption[Remove rows where C2 
# is FALSE.]caption
mydata <- mydata[mydata$C2 == TRUE,]

mydata$C6[is.na(mydata$C6)] <- mean(mydata$C6, na.rm = TRUE)
# snap mydata caption[Replace missing values in C6 and 
# C8 with mean values. Drop C7 because there are too many 
# missing values.]caption
mydata$C8[is.na(mydata$C8)] <- mean(mydata$C8, na.rm = TRUE)
mydata$C7 <- NULL

mydata$C9 <- mydata$C3 + mydata$C4
# end smallset mydata caption[Create a new column, 
# C9, by summing C3 and C4.]caption
```

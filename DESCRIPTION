Description: Data practitioners regularly use the 'R' and 'Python' programming languages to prepare 
    data for analyses. Thus, they encode data preprocessing decisions in 'R' and 'Python' scripts. 
    The 'smallsets' software subsequently decodes these decisions into a  Smallset Timeline, a 
    visualisation proposed in Lucchesi et al. (2022) <doi:10.1145/3531146.3533175>. A Smallset 
    Timeline is a series of small data snapshots of different preprocessing steps. The 'smallsets' 
    package builds this figure from a user's dataset and 'R'/'Python' preprocessing script, which 
    contains structured comments with snapshot instructions.

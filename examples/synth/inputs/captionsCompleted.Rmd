### Starting smallset

Caption: Remove rows where C2 is FALSE.

### `df$C8[is.na(df$C8)] <- round(as.numeric(levels(C8sub))[C8sub][is.na(df$C8)], 2)`

Caption: Replace missing values in C6 and C8 with category (C1) means. Drop C7 because it has too many missing values.

### Ending smallset

Caption: Create a new column, C9, by summing C3 and C4

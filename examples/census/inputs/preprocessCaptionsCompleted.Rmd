### Starting smallset

Caption: We first filter to individuals older than 16 years of age (*Agep*). After checking that all survey person weights (*Pwgtp*) are greater than or equal to one, we drop the column so it is not part of modelling. 

### Ending smallset

Caption: It is common to remove individuals with incomes less than 100 dollars or no reported value for average weekly hours worked (*Wkhp*). However, we want to keep these individuals in the dataset. We do not filter by income (we even keep reported losses, or negative incomes) and replace missing values in the *Wkhp* column with zero. The median income of the dataset, 22,500 dollars, is selected as the income threshold for the binary target label.

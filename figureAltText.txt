 This Smallset timeline is titled Smallset Timeline for Replicating Preprocessing of MDP CM1 Dataset. The Smallset timeline has footnote quote "Applying translation of preprocessing steps proposed in Gray et al. (2011)." The Smallset timeline contains 6 Smallset snapshots. Data edits are represented with the colour lightsteelblue2. Data deletions are represented with the colour moccasin.
 Snapshot 1 is 10 rows by 18 columns. The columns, in order from left to right, are: LOC_BLANK, CALL_PAIRS, LOC_CODE_AND_COMMENT, LOC_COMMENTS, CONDITION_COUNT, CYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY, DECISION_COUNT, DECISION_DENSITY, LOC_EXECUTABLE, GLOBAL_DATA_COMPLEXITY, GLOBAL_DATA_DENSITY, HALSTEAD_LENGTH, NUM_OPERANDS, NUM_OPERATORS, NUMBER_OF_LINES, PATHOLOGICAL_COMPLEXITY, LOC_TOTAL, and Defective. Columns GLOBAL_DATA_COMPLEXITY, GLOBAL_DATA_DENSITY, and PATHOLOGICAL_COMPLEXITY are moccasin.
 Snapshot 2 is 10 rows by 15 columns. The caption is quote "**Step 2:** Remove repeated attributes. There are none in CM1."
 Snapshot 3 is 10 rows by 15 columns. Five table cells are lightsteelblue2. The caption is quote "**Step 3:** The *Decision_density* attribute is the only attribute that contains missing values in CM1. This attribute is equal to the *Condition_count* divided by the *Decision_count*. Missing values only occur in *Decision_density* when both of these other attributes equal zero. In other MDP datasets, where both equal zero, so does *Decision_density*. Thus, the missing values are replaced with zero. (161 rows affected)"
 Snapshot 4 is 10 rows by 15 columns. The caption is quote "**Step 4:** All instances which fail one or more of the data integrity checks are removed from the dataset. The integrity checks identify instances that cannot realistically happen. The following integrity checks are used: *Num_operands* + *Num_operators* = *Halstead_length*; *Cyclomatic_complexity* <= *Num_operators* + 1; *Cyclomatic_complexity* >= 1; *Call_pairs* <= *Num_operators*. (0 rows affected)"
 Snapshot 5 is 10 rows by 15 columns. Two rows are moccasin. The caption is quote "**Step 5:** Remove repeated and inconsistent case. Duplicates are dropped (49 rows affected). Inconsistent cases refer to cases in which all values but the class label are equal, and these are dropped as well (2 rows affected)."
 Snapshot 6 is 8 rows by 15 columns. The caption is quote "The CM1 dataset is preprocessed and ready to be used in the analysis. The full version of CM1 and the R preprocessing code are available on GitHub (insert link here)."

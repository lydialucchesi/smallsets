# Contributing

Thank you for your cooperation and contribution! We appreciate your help making smallsets the best it can be.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it is a problem. If you have found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request guidelines

* Create a named branch (not main) which merges cleanly with main.
* Limit the scope of the pull request to a clearly defined improvement or fix.
* Please do not restyle code unrelated to your pull request.
* Use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) for documentation.
* For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of NEWS.md below the
current version header describing the changes you made followed by your GitHub username and links to relevant issues and pull requests.

Every pull request will be reviewed by @lydialucchesi. She will either merge it or provide feedback on issues to be addressed. She may add additional commits to the pull request and make minor edits to a pull request (e.g., fixing typos) before merging it.

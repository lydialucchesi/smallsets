# Contributing
Before making a substantial pull request, please file an issue and confirm the problem with @lydialucchesi. For bugs, create an issue and illustrate it with a minimal reproducible example.

## Pull Request Guidelines
* Create a named branch (not main).
* Limit the scope of the pull request to a clearly defined improvement or fix.
* Do not restyle code unrelated to your pull request.
* Use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) for documentation.
* For user-facing changes, add a bullet to [NEWS.md](NEWS.md) (below the
current version header) with the change, your GitHub username, and links to issues and pull requests.

Pull requests will be reviewed by @lydialucchesi. She will either merge it or provide feedback. She may add additional commits and make minor edits (e.g., fixing typos) to a pull request before merging it.

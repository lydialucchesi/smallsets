Do you use R or Python to preprocess datasets for analyses? `smallsets` is an R package that transforms your R/Python data preprocessing script into a Smallset Timeline, so that you can document and share your preprocessing decisions in a practical manner.

A full description of the Smallset Timeline can be found in the paper [**Smallset Timelines: A Visual Representation of Data Preprocessing Decisions**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3531146.3533175) in the proceedings of ACM FAccT '22. A short ([3 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fpn02h3IUo)) and long ([15 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_ksOv6rj1Y)) YouTube video provide an introduction to the project.

## Install from CRAN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("smallsets")
```

## Quick start example

Run this snippet of code to build your first Smallset Timeline!

```{r quick-start-example, eval=FALSE}
library(smallsets)

set.seed(145)

Smallset_Timeline(data = s_data,
                  code = system.file("s_data_preprocess.R", package = "smallsets"))
```

## Structured comments

The Smallset Timeline above is based on the R preprocessing script below (s_data_preprocess.R). Structured comments were added to it, informing `smallsets` what to do.

```{r, code=readLines(system.file("s_data_preprocess.R", package="smallsets")), eval=FALSE, class.source="view-only"}
```

## Citing `smallsets`

If you use the `smallsets` software, please cite the Smallset Timeline paper.

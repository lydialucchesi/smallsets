Do you use R or Python to preprocess datasets for analyses? `smallsets` is an R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=smallsets) that transforms the preprocessing code in your R, R Markdown, or Python script into a Smallset Timeline, a simple visualisation of preprocessing decisions. A full description of the Smallset Timeline can be found in the paper [**Smallset Timelines: A Visual Representation of Data Preprocessing Decisions**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3531146.3533175) in the proceedings of ACM FAccT '22. A short ([3 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fpn02h3IUo)) and long ([15 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_ksOv6rj1Y)) YouTube video provide an introduction to the project.

The `smallsets` user guide is available [here](https://lydialucchesi.github.io/smallsets/articles/smallsets.html) and in the package in `vignette("smallsets")`. If you have questions or would like help building a Smallset Timeline, please email Lydia at lydia.lucchesi@anu.edu.au.

## Install from CRAN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("smallsets")
```

## Quick start example

Run this snippet of code to build your first Smallset Timeline! It's based on the synthetic dataset s_data, with 100 observations and eight variables (C1-C8), and the preprocessing script s_data_preprocess.R, discussed in the following section.

```{r quick-start-example, eval=FALSE}
library(smallsets)

set.seed(145)

Smallset_Timeline(data = s_data,
                  code = system.file("s_data_preprocess.R", package = "smallsets"))
```

## Structured comments

The Smallset Timeline above is based on the R preprocessing script below, s_data_preprocess.R. Structured comments were added to it, informing `smallsets` what to do.

```{r, code=readLines(system.file("s_data_preprocess.R", package="smallsets")), eval=FALSE, class.source="view-only"}
```
